I am the team lead of Team 17 in the  Decentralized Umoja3 Hackathon and we were able to finish up our project on time.

My team worked on a the price is right guessing game with a different concept, we created the game as a casino where we have the house and the players. The house sets  the game  parameters, the players agree to those parameters, they  pay  their wagers and they play the game. The winner  of the game gets the wager  and if the game  ends with no winner the wager is been sent to  the house.

When the hack officially started my teammate and I were super hyped up  about this opportunity and we decided to give it a try, at  first I had issuses intalling reach and setting it up successfully but after some trial and error and and control Zs I was able to leave that  behind and move on to the next obstacles.

I had to critically understand the tutorial and I did alot of research on the previous umoja  projects, found the loopholes and corrected them to make my dapp flawless.

The first time I had issues when developing my reach file was how to make 3 participants making one the house aka deployer and the participants but I  figured that out too after looking up some of the  previous  projects and I understood how to  build  that out. Plus the Bear  hacks helped me a lot also.

My most challenging obstacle was how to return variables to the frontend and how to send them back to the backend also I had some issues understanding the crptographical features of reach and I was able to overcome those obstacles thanks to the bear hacks and Nick's youtube videos, to be honest the little  things really matter cause if not for those little challenges and the little words Nick always chips into his tutorial videos I wouldnt have overcome those obstacles.

I was surprised about how fast the index.rsh file compiles also how fast the transactions were and at the same time ensuring top tier security in my dapp  thanks to those theorem validations that take place while compiling.

If I was given a chance to give my dapp an update what I would create a better and colorful frontend GUI and also maybe add more options to play other games, like a full casino on algorand and maybe eth network fully implententing reach and would most likely go for a grant.

The past 6 weeks has been a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups and downs and frustrating errors  but  thanks to our  dedication and hardwork  we were able to complete our project came out sucessful, special thanks to  our mentor for guiding us to the path of success.
