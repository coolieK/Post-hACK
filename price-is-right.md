# The Price Is Right - Casino Edition 
  
## Meet the Team!   
 [Michael Chidubem](mailto:roseberrybushes365@gmail.com?subject=[Reach - The Price Is Right]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) as the Team Lead with Michael Lyon participated in the Decentralized Umoja3 Hackathon for the *Price Is Right* project.  
   
## Did you complete your project on time?  
We finished the project on time with lots of fun being a guessing game that we conceptualized to a Casino game.  
  
## Describe the primary features/functions of your app.  
 The Casino is the House and the Players are Participants. The house sets the game parameters, the players agree to those parameters, pay their wagers/bets and then, play the game. The winner of the game gets the total wager. If the game ends without a winner, the total wager is sent to the house.  
  
## What was going through your head at the start of the hack?  
When the hack officially started, we were super hyped with the opportunity and had to give it a try. At  first, we had issuses installing and setting Reach up, but after some trials, errors and control Zs, we nailed it and moved on to the next obstacles.  
  
## What did you do to dive into your project?  
Firstly, we had to critically understand the tutorials and secondly, did lots of research from the previous Decentralized Umoja projects. In the development process, we found various loopholes and corrected them to make the dApp flawless.  
  
## The first time you asked the community for help, what were you struggling with?  
Our first time issue when developing was how to create 3 participants in the Reach (*index.rsh*) file making one the House the *Deployer*, and the participants. We figured it out later after a deep research from the previous built Reach projects. Also, the *Bear Hacks* helped us a lot.  
  
## What were the most challenging obstacles to overcome (and how did you overcome them)?  
The most challenging obstacle was how to pass variables to the frontend from the backend and viceversa. We had some issues understanding the Reach crptographical features but were able to overcome them later, thanks to the Bear Hacks and [Nick Stanford's](https://www.youtube.com/c/Reachsh) youtube videos and to be honest, the little  things really matters. If it were not for the little challenges and the little words Nick says, *"Always chip into the videos tutorials"*, we wouldn't have overcome the obstacles.  
  
## What surprised you about building in Reach? Was anything faster/easier than you were expecting?  
We were surprised by the compiling speed of the *index.rsh* file. We paid respect the transactions processing speed too. At the same time, the platform ensures top tier security making our dApp applicable to a real world Casino. Thanks to the validations theorems that takes place while compiling a Reach project.  
    
## If given the chance to enhance/expand upon the features/functions of your app, what would you add?  
Given a chance enhance our dApp, we would use Reach to create a user friendly frontend GUI and add more gaming options to a full Casino game running on the Algorand and Ethereum blockchain mainnet networks for a grant.  
    
## Any closing thoughts on your project, the Bounty Hack, or building in Reach?  
The past 6 weeks has been a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups, downs and frustrating errors. Thanks to our dedication and hardwork, the project came out sucessful. A special thanks to our Mentor for guiding us to the path of success.
